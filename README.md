# HTTPWebResponseIssue
This project has been created for attracting ideas/approaches that I am facing with HTTPWebResponse

I have this code running quite fine some 7-8 months ago. From last few days, noticed that my HTTPWebResponse object is giving an "Operation Timed OUt" error. Previously, it used to work fine with the User Agent property uncommented.

Now, whenever I run my application, the first request gets completed successfully but after that every request I make, I get the operation timed out error.

I would deeply appreciate if anybody can help me out with this ...

PS: I tried WebClient class, HTTPClient class also but no success.

Please find the same query posted on StackOverflow forum for any further details:
